# WebsiteWithBot
A simple website for practice with a bot that will order items.
This is my first full stack website outside of school assignments. 
It uses REACT library, node.js, express framework to connect to a REST API on heroku
and uses a free PostgresSQL database from Heroku. This website is super simple
it only has a few items and is used to practice. The bot I create will help add items to your
cart and navagate you to the cart when finished. Also, it uses react-bootstrap to make this website
responsive.
